<p>This project introduces a system that provides a dynamic table-scale haptic feedback for virtual reality, by using a robot that can move one mug on the table to map three virtual mugs in virtual reality.

<h4 id="hardware">Hardware</h4>
<p>An accurate tracking system is essential for tracking objects in this project. A headset mounted display (HMD), two controllers, two lighthouse BASE stations, and two VIVE
trackers 2.0 made up the setup of the Vive System.

 <br />
By synchronizing information from the real and virtual worlds and giving commands to the robot, users can touch and lift objects in virtual content with their hands carrying the controller. When the user gives a demand to touch a specific mug, the robot is activated to reconfigure the real world.

Similarly, virtual contents also changes along with operation conducted to the real mug (such as moving it or lifting it by the user) to achieve a sense of reality.</p>

<p>How the Suspend/Resume mechanism of smartphone influences the power consumption is examined in the dissertation. Specifically, various unimportant and not so urgent network packets keep awakening the operating system (OS) at the time it is under suspend mode, and switch it from suspend to resume mode
continually, which results in more power consumption. Accordingly, an innovative optimization technique was suggested in this paper in order that the awakening of OS can be postponed and the lasting hour of suspend mode can be lengthened to decrease power consumption. Some experiments are also carried out, with
the result data suggesting that such technique is an effective way to reduce power consumption by greater than 7.63%. It proves that this technique is workable.</p>]]></content><author><name>Jekyll</name></author><category term="Article" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Abstract]]></summary></entry></feed>
