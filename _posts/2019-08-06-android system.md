## Abstract   

How the Suspend/Resume mechanism of smartphone influences the power consumption is examined in the dissertation. Specifically, various unimportant and not so urgent network packets keep awakening the operating system (OS) at the time it is under suspend mode, and switch it from suspend to resume mode
continually, which results in more power consumption. Accordingly, an innovative optimization technique was suggested in this paper in order that the awakening of OS can be postponed and the lasting hour of suspend mode can be lengthened to decrease power consumption. Some experiments are also carried out, with
the result data suggesting that such technique is an effective way to reduce power consumption by greater than 7.63%. It proves that this technique is workable.
